# Covid-19 Drive-Thru Test Site Source Data

GoodRX released [a
table](https://www.goodrx.com/blog/drive-thru-coronavirus-testing-near-me/)
of 446 COVID-19 Drive-Thru testing sites across the United States. We have
created an [ArcGIS Online map](http://ualabama.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Nearby/index.html?appid=afee605f98bb4e9b9886e613e8911038)
of this data to make it easier to locate these facilities. This
repository houses the GoodRX published table data in more user
friendly formats.
